# telegramBotRestaurant
Telegram bot for restaurant services

My first try to create telegram bot using C++ library tgbot-cpp, lot of bugs that I might fix in the future :)
Bot is saving all the orders in the text file, also there is function /reserve that is not used in the actual program but you can see it on main got.
In the future I might add payment method, fix some bugs and make better design and strucure for bot, many plans in future!
